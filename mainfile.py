                  """He who could address this audience without a quailing sensation, has stronger nerves than I 
have. I do not remember ever to have appeared as a speaker before any assembly more 
shrinkingly, nor with greater distrust of my ability, than I do this day. A feeling has crept over 
me, quite unfavorable to the exercise of my limited powers of speech. The task before me is 
one which requires much previous thought and study for its proper performance. I know that 
apologies of this sort are generally considered flat and unmeaning. I trust, however, that mine 
will not be so considered. Should I seem at ease, my appearance would much misrepresent 
me. The little experience I have had in addressing public meetings, in country school houses, 
avails me nothing on the present occasion.""",
